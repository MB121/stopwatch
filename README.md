The Stopwatch Application should have the following features:

Start/Pause Button: Initiates or halts the stopwatch timer.
Stop Button: Stops the stopwatch timer.
Reset Button: Resets the stopwatch timer to zero.
Functional Requirements:

Start/Pause Button:
Description: Users can start or pause the stopwatch timer by clicking on the Start/Pause button.

Acceptance Criteria: Clicking on the Start button initiates the stopwatch timer. When the stopwatch is running, clicking on the Pause button halts the timer at the current elapsed time. Clicking on the Pause button again resumes the timer from the paused time.

Stop Button:
Description: Users can stop the stopwatch timer at any point.

Acceptance Criteria: Clicking on the Stop button halts the stopwatch timer and displays the final elapsed time. The stopwatch timer resets to zero after stopping.

Reset Button:
Description: Users can reset the stopwatch timer to zero.

Acceptance Criteria: Clicking on the Reset button resets the stopwatch timer to zero. This action clears any previous elapsed time.

Non-Functional Requirements:

-> The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.

-> Button actions should be responsive and clearly visible.

-> The application should be compatible with modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
